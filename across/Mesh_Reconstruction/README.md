# Mesh Reconstruction

This package contains code to train VAE's to Reconstruct a Digit or BioTac Mesh.

## Usage 

The model can be trained using `python train_fem.py` while using `across/Mesh_Reconstruction/src` as the working directory.

By running `python encode_fem.py` the latent space of the Dataset can be retrieved.

## Note
Training this model takes a bit of time, so using GPU is recommended.
